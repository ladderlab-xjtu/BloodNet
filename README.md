#  BloodNet: An attention-based deep network for accurate, efficient, and costless bloodstain time since deposition inference
****
## The time since deposition (TSD) of a bloodstain, i.e., the time of a bloodstain formation is an essential piece of biological evidence in crime scene investigation. The practical usage of these existing microscopic methods is limited, as their performance strongly relies on high-end instrumentation and/or rigorous laboratory conditions. This paper presents a practically applicable deep learning-based method (i.e., BloodNet) for efficient, accurate, and costless TSD inference from a macroscopic view, i.e., by using easily accessible bloodstain photos. To this end, we established a benchmark database containing around 50,000 photos of bloodstains with varying TSDs.
